Python Belgrade #29 [Speedy Steamboat] 
======================================

On the 29th meetup we had an honor to hear about "Black-box testing" from `Alexander Todorov`_ founder of `Kiwi TCMS`_.

    **Topic**: Black-box testing with Kiwi TCMS

    - Quick intro of the Kiwi TCMS open source project
    - Quick info about the black box hardware
    - Share with the audience why these black boxes exist and what kinds of biases they serve to demonstrate.

    The talk will be mostly be around hardware Kiwi TCMS boxes, Alexander will be bringing a couple of them so that the attendees will be able to play around with them throughout the event.

The `black boxes`_ from demonstrations were made by Pionir free school. You can donate to Pionir school here_.
