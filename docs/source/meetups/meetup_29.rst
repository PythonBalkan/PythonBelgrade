Automatic dependency injection using type annotations

- Abstract:
Do you use type hints in your Python code? Do you apply engineering techniques such as inversion of control to decouple your application? If done properly, type annotations can be used to construct information about dependencies between classes. Inseminator library does exactly that and thus helps to simplify the application entrypoint.
