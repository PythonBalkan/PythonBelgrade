Chaos Engineering:Kill Your Own Servers for the Greater Good

.. toctree::
  ../speakers/speaker_36

- Abstract:
On the cutting edge of technology, engineers have this new mania about this so-called "Chaos Engineering" â€” which is essentially ops people willfully breaking their own infrastructure. Crazy, right? Why would anyone do this? Just to show off? To fight off boredom? Is it just some manifestation of masochist tendencies? Well, it's actually none of the above, so I'll try to explain the whys and hows of this fascinating concept in my talk.

Using Python for source-to-source translations
---

.. toctree::
  ../speakers/speaker_37

- Abstract:
Source-to-source translation is a process of taking a program written in one programming language as an input, and producing the equivalent source code in another programming language. First, we will give a short introduction to the source-to-source translation. Afterwards, we will show how such translations can be implemented in Python.
