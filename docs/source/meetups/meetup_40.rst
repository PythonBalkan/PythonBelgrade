- Abstract:
Business growth today depends not just on adopting new software tools, but on integrating them with data and AI technologies -mostly Open Source Software. By embedding your organization's expertise in AI models, you can not only persist and scale knowledge to maintain a competitive advantage but also free creative resources for new business models. Instead of being swayed by the noise on eg. LinkedIn and other people's ideas and successes, focus on building your own data & AI solutions.

In this discussion, I will present five key insights, demonstrated through use cases:

1. AI Implementation: Moving beyond a high-level understanding of AI, we'll explore guidelines and best practices for identifying the right starting point for AI adoption in your business.

2. From Prototypes to Production: Although open source and boilerplate code make prototyping easier, we'll examine various use cases to understand how to transition from prototypes to production, and other options to consider.

3. Navigating the Journey: Learn best practices for dealing with your business's legacy systems and determine when migrating to Open Source is a viable plan.

4. Driving Impact at Scale: Innovation encompasses various elements, including cloud, open source software, software engineering, and corporate culture. We'll discuss architectural best practices for managing multiple components simultaneously.

5. Overcoming Inexperience: If you have the necessary resources but lack experience, discover how to identify missing elements and accelerate progress in your digital transformation journey.

Each of these insights will be supported by real-life use cases, demonstrating the challenges and solutions involved in maximizing AI's value for your business and maintaining a competitive edge. Furthermore, integrating AI effectively can also enhance company culture and contribute to happier, more engaged employees, creating additional value for your organization.
