- Abstract:
Lots of modern projects are using object oriented paradigm as if it is the only one. But is it really non-avoidable or more convenient for most tasks?

In this talk we would like to point out problems of object oriented paradigm.

We would like to go through several use-cases and see if there are cases when oop solution is not optimal or even not possible.
