- Abstract:
Valentina Đorđević from Things Solver and Miloš Popović from Totient will team up and give an exciting two-hour lecture. They will guide us through the magical ride of deep learning and TensorFlow basics, as well as user friendly high level API for deep learning called "Keras". But that’s not all- to make things more interesting, they will do it with a widely accessible dataset and provide materials that will allow you to do it yourself at home.
This lecture will require familiarity with Python, but it will not assume any knowledge of neural networks.
