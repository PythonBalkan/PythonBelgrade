        "abstract": "Every project has its unique history and limitations. In this session, I will navigate you through three levels of implementing DDD in Django, from basic to advanced. You will understand how to apply DDD to your Django project strategically and tactically and learn how to balance the costs and benefits of each level.\n\nLevel 0: Ubiquitous Language and Bounded Contexts\n\nWe'll begin with an easy-to-implement approach, focusing on strategic DDD patterns. Then, we'll delve into creating Ubiquitous Language and discovering Bounded Contexts through Event Storming sessions - an engaging technique to visualize and define domains collaboratively.\n\nLevel 1: DDD tactical patterns\n\nWe'll move on to tactical patterns like entity, aggregate, repository, and domain services. Here, you'll understand how the standard usage of Django models may lead to a lack of integrity and how DDD patterns can provide business-level integrity.\n\nLevel 2: Advanced DDD\n\nFinally, we'll explore advanced DDD techniques. We'll cover how to design a domain layer in pure Python independent of the framework and why this approach can lead to cleaner, more testable code.\n\nTakeaways\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will have:\n\nA clear understanding of implementing DDD in Django projects at different levels based on your requirements.\n\nA solid grasp of the strategic and tactical patterns in DDD and how they can improve your Django project.\n\nHands-on experience in creating Ubiquitous Language and discovering Bounded Contexts through Event Storming sessions.\n\nKnowledge of how to ensure business-level integrity in your project using DDD tactical patterns.\n\nInsights on how to write a domain layer in pure Python, independent of the framework, and how it can lead to cleaner, more testable code.\n\nEngagement\n\nIn this session, I will focus on linking theory with practical examples. Drawing from my experience refactoring a 5-year-old Django monolith, which continues to be actively developed by five different teams, I have many real-world examples to illustrate different approaches.",

By embedding your organization's expertise in AI models, you can not only persist and scale knowledge to maintain a competitive advantage but also free creative resources for new business models. Instead of being swayed by the noise on eg. LinkedIn and other people's ideas and successes, focus on building your own data & AI solutions.\n\nIn this discussion, I will present five key insights, demonstrated through use cases:\n\n1. AI Implementation: Moving beyond a high-level understanding of AI, we'll explore guidelines and best practices for identifying the right starting point for AI adoption in your business.\n\n2. From Prototypes to Production: Although open source and boilerplate code make prototyping easier, we'll examine various use cases to understand how to transition from prototypes to production, and other options to consider.\n\n3. Navigating the Journey: Learn best practices for dealing with your business's legacy systems and determine when migrating to Open Source is a viable plan.\n\n4. Driving Impact at Scale: Innovation encompasses various elements, including cloud, open source software, software engineering, and corporate culture. We'll discuss architectural best practices for managing multiple components simultaneously.\n\n5. Overcoming Inexperience: If you have the necessary resources but lack experience, discover how to identify missing elements and accelerate progress in your digital transformation journey.\n\nEach of these insights will be supported by real-life use cases, demonstrating the challenges and solutions involved in maximizing AI's value for your business and maintaining a competitive edge. Furthermore, integrating AI effectively can also enhance company culture and contribute to happier, more engaged employees, creating additional value for your organization.",

        ],
        "abstract": "Purpose for this study is to introduce the concept behind microservices, differences between microservices and monolithic applications, benefits and pitfalls of each and scaling. Inspiration for this came from the issues that I have encountered while working with large monolithic applications, mainly regarding scaling and speed of the service. Having all of the code in one place in early stages of development is better, lets you develop faster which is critical when starting, is less complicated to share between developers and allows for easier deployment in one go. But, as the codebase and complexity of the app grows, all of these pros that made it easier in the beginning, can gradually make a monolith harder to develop and maintain. Implementing microservices can be time consuming, but will allow for better scaling in the long run if applied at the right time - not too soon, not too late. Why microservices? Flexibility, scalability and robustness are main pros of implementing microservices. It will make a way to organize complex systems, breaking them down into smaller pieces that communicate with each other and deployed independently. They can also be written in different languages, giving the app even more flexibility. Why gRPC over REST? Well, we can use REST for microservices as well, but there are many pros in using protocol buffers. Performance, documentation and validation are the main ones. gRPC is built on top of HTTP/2 which can make multiple requests in parallel and is more efficient in this case, when using it for internal communication. Also, gRPC has interceptors that are used to monitor the communication between services, logging exceptions, requests and latencies. Generally, a go-to for our case and we will cover it in depth.",
